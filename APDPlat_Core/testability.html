      <p class="suggestion">Since these static methods are complex, we want to mock them out in the unit test. If they are declared in your code, refactor the methods to be non-static, and inject an instance of the class. Otherwise, you can create a wrapper object.</p>

      <p class="suggestion">This method call can't be mocked out from a unit test because the test cannot control how the object is instantiated. This can be caused by: - the object was created using new, - it was returned by a non-mockable collaborator, or - the method is declared final or private, which prevents overriding in a subclass</p>
